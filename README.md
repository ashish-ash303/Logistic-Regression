# Logistic-Regression

Logistic regression is a commonly used technique for solving binary classification problems. In a logistic regression model:

1.we take linear combination (or weighted sum of the input features)

2.we apply the sigmoid function to the result to obtain a number between 0 and 1

3.this number represents the probability of the input being classified as "Yes"

4.instead of RMSE, the cross entropy loss function is used to evaluate the results

How Can we classify Regression Problem ?: Problems where each input must be assigned a discrete category (also called label or class) are known as classification problems.
